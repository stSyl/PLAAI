    "TASK": "The Factual Knowledge pattern utilizes the extensive factual knowledge of AI language models to provide answers across a wide variety of subjects. This is especially valuable in discourse, since answers can be obtained immediately, specific to a given context, and can be further clarified and augmented in follow-up questions. Challenges arise from the training data cutoff date, the AI's propensity to state \"Schr√∂dinger Facts\" - i.e. factually wrong statements, presented with great conviction - when no actual information exists, and by the AI's biased treatment of some subjects, which has been introduced by alignment training. Effective use requires asking precise questions, engaging critically with the answers, and understanding the limitations.",
