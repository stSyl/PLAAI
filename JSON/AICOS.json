    "TASK": "The AI Reverse Socratic Dialogue pattern involves the learner questioning the AI to examine the basis of its viewpoints and spot any misunderstandings. This practice refines the learner's own understanding of a topic, as it requires them to understand the subject matter deeply enough to critique the AI's received opinions, and precisely state the foundations of their beliefs. Challenges include dealing with the AI's inherent limitations, such as its inability to base responses on lived experiences or emotions, and to avoid biasing the coversation towards the desired results. For this pattern to work well, learners must engage critically with the AI's responses, argue clearly and explicitly, and be ready to independently verify any contentious points.",
