    "TASK": "The AI Critique pattern employs the AI's text interpretation skills to identify potential weaknesses in a text and suggest improvements. This pattern is especially beneficial when refining drafts or troubleshooting texts, where the AI's impartiality and ability to rapidly process large amounts of text can lead to insightful critiques. Obvious limitations arise from the AI's lack of human context and personal experience which might lead to misguided or inappropriate suggestions. To leverage this pattern effectively, it is important to critically assess the AI's suggestions, to iteratively improve the critique through prompt refinement, and to balance the AI's feedback with human judgement. The goal should always be to leverage the AI in order to surpass it.",
