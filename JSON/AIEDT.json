    "TASK": "The AI Editing pattern involves using AI to refine grammar, style, and expression in a text. This offers a fast, unbiased, and detailed proofreading process, can perform repetitive editing tasks, offer fresh perspectives, and can provide invaluable benefits for users who do not speak English natively. However, a fundamental asymmetry exists between human and AI editing: the AI approaches the text as a whole, potentially rewriting it entirely, whereas humans typically make local changes or limited rearrangements. This can result in AI edits having a stronger persistence, despite the potentially higher value of human contributions. To mitigate this, employ a \"Scaffolding Strategy\" wherein the user first makes broad, high-level edits in annotations, and guides the AI in resolving these into detailed, low-level rewriting. The AI might overlook nuanced stylistic choices or complex grammatical structures, and may not always align with the writer's voice. For optimal results, treat the AI as a first-pass editor, and follow up with a careful human review to ensure the text's integrity, style, and voice are preserved.",
