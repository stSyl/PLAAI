    "TASK": "The AI Planning and Guidance pattern leverages the AI's understanding of context and process knowledge to propose, sequence, and prioritize steps to execute a task. This is particularly useful in complex, multi-step projects or when the user is inexperienced or uncertain about the best approach. The AI's ability to remain unbiased and to consider a plurality of options are especially valuable. Since this early stage of planning will lock the user into a particular plan of action, care needs to be taken to consider and evaluate alternatives, make an informed choice among them, and ideally include decision points that evaluate and revise the plan as it proceeds. Take this into account when drafting prompts.",
