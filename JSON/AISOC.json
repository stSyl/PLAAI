    "TASK": "The AI Socratic Dialogue pattern utilizes the AI to emulate a Socratic dialogue, questioning the learner to lead them to their own insights. This approach encourages self-directed learning and deeper understanding of the subject matter. The challenges include ensuring the AI poses appropriate questions that guide learners towards the desired insights and dealing with frustration if the AI's questioning isn't well-aligned with the learner's thinking. To work well, this pattern requires careful calibration of the AI's difficulty level and the use of open-ended questions that stimulate critical thinking.",
