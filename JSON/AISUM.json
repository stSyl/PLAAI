    "TASK": "The AI Generated Summaries pattern capitalizes on the AI's text understanding capabilities to generate concise summaries of text content. This is particularly beneficial for processing lengthy documents, from which the AI can distill key points quickly and impartially. The main challenge lies in the AI's potential to misjudge the relative importance of different points in the text, which could lead to unbalanced summaries and the limited length of the context window. It is crucial to critically review the AI's summaries not only as representations of the source but also in their own right, iteratively refine both the generative process as well as the summary itself, and guide the AI's focus through well-crafted prompts. Use a marker strategy to ensure instructions remain intact, and summarize longer text in pieces.",
