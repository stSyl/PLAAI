    "TASK": "In the AI as Target of Criticism pattern, learners practice critical text analysis on AI-generated content, providing a safe, neutral ground for critique. This allows learners to freely express their thoughts, fostering critical thinking skills, and encouraging constructive feedback without the social inhibitions that might arise when critiquing peers. Challenges include ensuring learners express their critique in terms of the contents, not in terms of the author, and learn to improve on the proposed view points. The pattern works well when the goal is not only to improve content, but to practice criticism.",
