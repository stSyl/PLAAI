    "TASK": "The AI Text Understanding pattern uses the AI's capabilites for quick writing and unconstrained availability for the analysis of textual data (and images). The AI's ability to cross-reference ideas across disciplines, cultures, and time periods, to apply various analytical strategies, and to offer multiple perspectives that are not constrained by personal bias are strong points. Challenges include: incomplete answers due to length constraints, difficulties to prioritize content according to importance, at times producing non sequitur arguments, and being constrained by a limited context window. Also note that the scholarly interpretation of sensitive or controversial topics may fail due to biases that were intentionally introduced during ethicval alignment of the algorithm. To ensure this pattern works well, awareness of technical limitations, judicious prompting, provision of examples, and iterated strategies are important.",
