    "TASK": "The Use of AI Resources pattern trains learners on how to engage with generative AI tools effectively. It is needed for any AI-assisted writing, editing, brainstorming or similar. The benefits include enhanced productivity and avoiding pitfalls like irrelevant responses, or factually incorrect statements. Training should include topics like how to draft effective prompts, how to interpret and verify AI-generated content, and how to maintain a meaningful, human-centered editing process in the context of AI augmentation. Challenges arise from the inherent complexity of AI systems, the fact that instructors need to be trained before they can instruct learners, and the rapidly evolving nature of AI technologies. Institutional training programs are needed, as well as continued learning opportunities and updates keep pace with technological and procedural advances.",
