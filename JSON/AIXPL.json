    "TASK": "The AI Generated Explanations pattern builds on the AI's ability to consider context and user needs to provide individualized explanations that are knowledgeable and tailored to the task at hand. The pattern is especially impactful when learners have diverse backgrounds, prior knowledge, or learning styles. Note that individualization may lead to inconsistent explanations between learners, be aware when that could be an issue. To be effective, context and user needs must be suitably captured and communicated to the AI.",
