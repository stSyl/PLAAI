    "TASK": "The Course Scope pattern establishes the extent of course activities and outlines the learning objectives. This pattern presents a roadmap for the educational journey and signals to learners their expected gains from the course. Challenges may arise from a scope that's either too broad, risking superficial coverage, or too narrow, which may limit learners' understanding. The pattern's success depends on maintaining balance, considering learners' existing knowledge, their learning objectives, and available resources.",
