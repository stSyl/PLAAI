    "TASK": "The Course Mapping pattern assists learners in defining course-related activities in a sequential manner and planning when to engage with them. Its chief objective is to align requirements with individual learning goals while resolving scheduling constraints. To reap optimal benefits, learners should define their objectives, harmonize their study schedule with these targets, utilize checkpoints or assessments for progress tracking, and tailor their engagement with the course material based on their distinct learning styles and needs.",
