    "TASK": "The Educational Outcomes pattern maps the intended results of a learning process or program. The pattern's prime aim is to clarify what learners are expected to understand, perform or acquire upon completion of a course or program. The pattern encounters challenges like unrealistic or vague expectations, and a mismatch between the course content, instructional methods, or assessment strategies. To optimally utilize this pattern, the establishment of measurable, explicit and attainable outcomes that align with course content, instructional methods, and assessment strategies is essential. Regular appraisal and adjustment of these outcomes based on learner performance and feedback also prove effective.",
