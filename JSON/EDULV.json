    "TASK": "Educational Livestreaming extends the reach of traditional teaching by broadcasting educational content in real-time. The appeal of this pattern lies in its capacity to provide an engaging learning experience, interacting with an unlimited number of learners simultaneously. To make this method most effective, a discourse with a small group of participants is encouraged to promote vicarious learning. Further, technical obstacles and different time zones should be considered â€“ a stable streaming platform and recordings for later viewing can help. Enhancements such as live chats, Q&A sessions, and polls can further boost engagement.",
