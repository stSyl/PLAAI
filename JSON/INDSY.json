    "TASK": "The Interdisciplinary Connections pattern works towards linking concepts and skills across diverse disciplines, thereby enriching the learning experience and bolstering critical thinking. By identifying relevant intersections between disciplines, designing activities that nurture these connections, and aiding learners in recognizing and applying these links in varied contexts, this pattern proves to be an effective tool for comprehensive learning. It is important, however, to ensure that these connections don't lead to content dilution or confuse learners, which requires careful structuring and scaffolding of activities.",
