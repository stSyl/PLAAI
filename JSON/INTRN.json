    "TASK": "The Embedded Learning pattern integrates learning within real-world contexts such as internships or project-based experiences. This offers learners an authentic application of their knowledge, preparing them for future professional roles, and fostering a deeper understanding. The challenge lies in maintaining a balance between learning goals and work demands, and ensuring adequate support and feedback mechanisms are in place. The pattern thrives when learning objectives are explicitly defined, and learning is scaffolded through guided reflections and feedback loops.",
