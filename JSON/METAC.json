    "TASK": "The Metacognitive Strategies pattern supports learners in becoming aware of their own thinking processes, which contributes significantly to the development of self-regulated learning skills. To effectively employ this pattern, educators should model metacognitive strategies, guide learners in goal setting, planning, monitoring progress, and evaluating their learning. This approach's challenge lies in its inherently introspective nature, which may be difficult for some learners to grasp. Overcoming this challenge involves providing clear examples, frequent feedback, and opportunities for practice.",
