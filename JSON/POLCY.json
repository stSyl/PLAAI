    "TASK": "Policy Resources consist of various documents and guidelines, such as the course syllabus, academic integrity policy, student conduct policy, and community standards of best practice and professionalism. The primary task of this pattern is to ensure these resources remain relevant and updated, particularly in light of emerging generative AI issues. This involves regular review and revision of policies to incorporate considerations for AI use, while continuing to uphold academic standards and promote a professional and respectful learning environment. The challenge lies in understanding and addressing the diverse implications of generative AI, and effectively communicating these changes to all stakeholders in the learning community.",
