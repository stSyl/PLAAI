Constraints that reduce the effectiveness of the solution are also stated, and how those constraints can be addressed. Therefore the task description defines the reason for the pattern to exist and outlines what needs to be done to make it work well. The description is thus structured by answering the questions: (1) What is it? (2) Why is it useful or important? (3) What challenges affect it? (4) What makes it work well?",
