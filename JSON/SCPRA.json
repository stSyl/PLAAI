    "TASK": "The Scholarly Practices pattern aims at nurturing students' ability to develop and apply research skills such as conducting investigations, authoring academic papers, and presenting findings. By fostering a culture of ongoing learning and growth, this pattern aids learners in fine-tuning their abilities throughout their academic journey. However, the pattern must balance the need for rigor and the risk of overwhelming learners. As such, providing clear guidelines, appropriate resources, and timely feedback will bolster its effectiveness.",
