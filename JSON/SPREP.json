    "TASK": "The Spaced Repetition pattern enables learners to revisit and reinforce previously learned material at increasing intervals, which significantly enhances long-term retention of knowledge. The challenge with this pattern lies in the careful scheduling and regular opportunities for recall. To effectively implement the pattern, educators should design a review schedule, provide regular opportunities for recall, and encourage learners to self-assess and adapt their study habits based on their performance.",
