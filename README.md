# PLAAI - A Pattern Language for AI-Augmented Instruction

(The Sentient Syllabus Project)


The “Pattern Language for AI-Augmented Instruction” (PLAAI) is a structured approach to designing and implementing educational experiences that are enhanced by artificial intelligence. 

PLAAI focuses on the integration of AI technologies – generative AI Language Models like ChatGPT – into education. This is developed as a “pattern language”, where _patterns_ are reusable solutions to common processes in education. PLAAI patterns include lectures, discussions, group work and the like. By providing practical advice and resources for the integration of AI, i.e. explanations, recipes, prompts etc., PLAAI provides an approach that is independent  of specific tools, resources, or pedagogies. Following this approach, educators will find ways to personalize instruction, increase engagement, and facilitate richer learning experiences across cognitive, associative, social, and practical domains. Since PLAAI is structured as a “language”, it is natural to create and combine patterns to rich constructs, like modules, courses, or entire programs, and it is straightforward to consider alternatives at every step. The results are assets that are effective, inclusive, and adaptable to learners' needs.

This GitHub project coordinates a community approach to developing PLAAI as best-practice in higher education.

### Status

<small>(Reverse chronological)</small>

2023-05-24
* A bare-bones JS powered editing template for the JSON files was developed.
* R code was developed to transform the patterns into [Markdown pages](https://github.com/stSyl/PLAAI/tree/main/docs/md), and to create an [interactive map](https://stsyl.github.io/PLAAI/PLAAI-reference.html) of the patterns, with clickable links.
* A first set of patterns was developed as a spreadsheet, then transformed into individual [JSON files](https://github.com/stSyl/PLAAI/tree/main/JSON).
* The basic design of the structure of a pattern has been completed.
* A full ontology has been defined.
* The basic PLAAI concepts have been defined: focus on education, create composable patterns, include AI advice wherever possible - not separated from, but integrated with educational concerns.
* The project was initated, a stub was created here and a GitHub pages site was attached to this repository.

#### Next steps

* PLAII needs three integrated components: (1) a dictionary of patterns; (2) a compendium of processes; and (3) a repository of resources. The dictionary is well on its way. Build the process compendium next, and as necessary add resources.
* Fill more patterns with contents
