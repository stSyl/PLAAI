## Task:
<!--TASK-->The purpose of the Lecture pattern is to transmit information through a human, oral interpretation. Despite the long tradition and ubiquitous use of lectures, there is significant scope for improvement, including: having learners participate actively, individualizing the pace and the instruction level, and addressing missing prerequisite knowledge.<!--/TASK-->

## Details:
<!--DETAILS-->It would not be wrong to consider the lecture to be the defining activity of the academy: an authority, proclaiming their views to an audience of learners. There are apparently significant benefits to listening to an other, which engages both verbal and non-verbal channels of communication. Merits that are specific to the lecture format include:
* Speech: many learners absorb information more easily from listening to explanations than from reading them.
* Pacing: the typical pace of speech is well suited for comprehension.
* Scale: the typical length of a lecture matches our attention spans and the amount of information we can pick up at one time.
* Responsiveness: during live delivery, a lecture can adapt to learners’ questions or comments.
* Focus: lectures focus learners together as a group in a single event, which has an important social function. Through that, they constitute the foundation of material that every learner can be assumed to know.
* Practice: much is known about how to lecture well, much has been written about best practice, and many tools exist to support lecture delivery.
These benefits are significant, but each point deserves to be reconsidered, and may be improved.

Some disciplines still have a culture of reading lectures out loud from prepared manuscripts. That is no longer considered best practice. Instructors who do this may be unaware how much their audience resents this mode of presentation; it may be better to simply supply the audience with the manuscript instead and use the speaking time to tell a story – for example: why the lecture contents became important and what significance it has for you personally. Sharing personal perspectives through your own voice, that is where the lecture format remains most convincing. Indeed, all explicit memories from past lectures that I have attended consist of such personal moments.

Consider what we could do. We all have been in the situation of discussing a significant piece of work, a discovery, or cultural artefact. But to examine it in its context requires an investment that we simply can’t properly fit into the limited time of the course. Take the _Iliad_ for example. The climax of book 22, the death of Hector through Achilles’ spear, amid a complex web of mortal grievances, divine interventions, attempts to remain human and yet falling to fate, this all is an enduring foundation of human culture in a profoundly well crafted poetic format. But to discuss it? Would that not require pre-reading the 24 books of Homer, plus a good part of scholarship? Would these kinds of assignments inspire learners to engage more deeply, or turn them off the Classics forever? Or would we work from notes and summaries, stuck in the superficial presentation of storylines? We have another way now. It has become entirely reasonable to take an excerpt from such a text in its original form and present it in a lecture. Of course, the learners would lack context – but the AI can answer questions, and pursue them, and go deeper, to present exactly what a learner needs at the time they need it. This ability to switch between presentation and participation, between taking stock of what is known and exploring what is not, this is a significant departure from the way we used to work with content, and a significant opportunity to bring it to life and make it personal. Above all, we are now much better able to put the learner in control of their learning.

For the lecture format, audience engagement has always been an issue since lectures are inherently passive modes of information transmission, not active learning. Treating them as opportunities for active involvement instead, and integrating dynamically generated content is a great opportunity. We are not even speaking of moving to full-on discussions as a replacement for lectures. Even a format in which content is partially developed in dialogue with selected audience members, while including the AI in the discourse, would help. If well done, this will allow the audience to engage with the situation vicariously, similar to watching a sports or gaming event, and engage with the material almost without realizing it.

Lectures occupy their allocated time slots fully, can neither be accelerated nor slowed down, and to individualize them in the way we just discussed takes thought. A general solution is to take check-in breaks, in which we switch between static and dynamic content and engage with the audience, to adjust the pace, to give learners an opportunity to catch up on explanations of concepts that might be unfamiliar to them, and to solve other issues with lacking preparation. At the same time, learners may bridge gaps due to a lapse in attention, which might otherwise prevent them from following the rest of the lecture – and it may provide interfaces for personalization. (As an aside, an excellent way to promote continued focus and avoid such gaps is to encourage effective note-taking during lectures.)

Similarly, lectures are given at a specific date, which may not be the right date for self-paced learning. This can be mitigated after the lecture, by AI assisted debriefing and follow-up, at the learner’s pace.

Personalizing the experience supports the crucial social benefits of a joint scholarly effort at an event. Imagine not “giving” a lecture but celebrating it, and develop ideas about framing the lecture that can support a sense of purpose and excitement for the audience.<!--/DETAILS-->

## AI concerns:
<!--AI-->All activities below are implied to be collaborations with the AI. Many of the suggestions result in artefacts, ideally, these are organized in a knowledge repository.

Preparing the lecture:
* Prepare a written script from the raw lecture slides, as a basis for further transformations.
* Based on the script, revise lecture outlines to a length of one slide per minute or less.
* Review the lecture contents. Ask for an unbiased critique of the lecture content that identifies potential areas of bias or underrepresentation of perspectives, and mentions alternative viewpoints. Ask for suggestions for interdisciplinary connections and real-world problems. Ask an AI with access to the internet about recent discoveries, controversies in the field, or related current events. Predict potential questions or confusion points that students might have, based on the lecture content, so they can be proactively addressed.
* If the lecture is based on a manuscript, transform it into a set of keywords for free narration instead. These can be written on index cards to guide the lecture, or appear on the lecture slides.
* Condense lengthy text in slides to an appropriate length: 40 words or less.
* Generate a list of key concepts and related reading resources that students can review in advance.
* Draft an announcement for the lecture, mention required or suggested audience preparation, manage expectations and create anticipation.
* Create handouts.
* Prepare a self-assessment quiz for students to assess their level of preparedness for the lecture.
* Prepare speech-to-text: having a transcribed version of the lecture available will be useful. Apps and services are available, the technology is progressing rapidly. OpenAI's Whisper transcription language model can be run locally in a Jupyter notebook.

During the lecture:
* Use check-in breaks every ten minutes or so. This provides opportunities to involve the AI when you realign the lecture with the audience. During the break, ask the AI to summarize where the lecture is at, based on the script, or on the slides that were covered. Or ask it for questions it would like to have clarified: unlike a human audience, the AI will always have something to say. Or ask the AI to summarize the progress of the lecture so far. Then ask the human audience whether this is a correct understanding. This introduces a stimulating, competitive aspect to understanding the contents.
* If a real-time transcript is available, the AI can craft self-evaluation questions for students at check-in breaks.
* If a chat is available, the AI can summarize  the  general understanding among the members of the audience, and identify shared problems. We can anticipate that students are more motivated to contribute feedback to the chat if their contributions result in something constructive, or get them noticed. (Chat contributions may be a component of participation marks.) Encourage students specifically to contribute questions.
* Periodically ask the AI to anticipate upcoming points in the lecture based on the content covered so far. "What do you think will come next." This will focus the audience's attention on the structure of contents: was the AI right?

Post-lecture:
* Have the audience collaborate with the AI to generate a shared set of possible follow-up topics - points of clarification, or unanswered questions - for the next lecture.
* Create an FAQ document based on questions that were asked in the chat, or on common areas of confusion in similar topics.
* Ask for a summary of the lecture in various formats (e.g., mind maps, bullet points, long-form text, flash cards, study notes) to support different learning styles.
* Generate practice problems or application scenarios based on the lecture's key points.
* Analyze the chat transcript (if available) to summarize student comments and sentiment, identify frequently asked questions, and note areas of confusion or high engagement.
* To support continuous and self-paced learning, set-up a debriefing process that students can engage with at the time that is most suitable for them. Include the lecture script and transcript in a knowledge repository to support this.
* Generate individualized homework assignments that are tailored to different learning levels, levels of preparation, and learning styles.
* Generate a glossary of important terms and concepts from the lecture to be made available in a knowledge repository.

## Implementation:
<!--IMPLEMENTATION-->Treat the lecture as an exciting, inspiring event, and share the excitement with your audience. The use of AI in the preparation and post-processing of lectures follows established patterns of collaboration. Transform the lecture into a script, as a resource to interface with the AI and enable its contributions to the content. Share results in a knowledge repository. Interleave your delivery with check-in breaks, to add a discursive, participatory dimension. And: consider alternatives with a stronger active-learning component.<!--/IMPLEMENTATION-->
